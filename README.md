# google-populartimes-java
_This code is a re-implementation of the python script [populartimes](https://github.com/m-wrzr/populartimes) by @m-wrzr. For now it provides nearly the same functionalities as the original script, but its functionality might be adapted and extended in the future. 
Feel free to contribute by submitting issues and pull requests._

The goal of this library is to provide an option to use *Google Maps* popular times data, until it is available via Google's API. As Google Maps is constantly updated this library can  be unstable.
